Detailed Software Architecture: Fishing Route Optimizer (FRO)
üß© Objective:
Build a smart, data-driven application that helps fishermen predict optimal fishing zones and generate the best navigation routes based on:

Historical catch data

Real-time ocean and weather conditions

Time, species, and environmental trends

üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components
1. User Interface (Frontend Layer)
Platforms:

Mobile app: Flutter

Web dashboard: ReactJS or Next.js

Key Features:

Interactive marine map with zone overlays

Route suggestions with distance, fuel estimate, and weather forecast

Filters by species, time, and confidence levels

Manual catch report submission (location, time, species, size)

User authentication, saved trips, offline map caching

2. External Data Integration Layer
Purpose: Fetch real-time and forecast data from verified sources
Data Sources:

NOAA API ‚Äì sea surface temperature, current, tides

OpenWeatherMap API ‚Äì weather conditions, wind, storm alerts

Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) ‚Äì ocean salinity, chlorophyll levels

Fishermen community reports ‚Äì manually uploaded trip reports

Tools:

RESTful API clients

Scheduled jobs with cron or serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda / Cloud Functions)

3. Data Processing & ETL Pipeline
Tools:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, GeoPandas)

Apache Airflow (optional, for scheduling ETL)

Steps:

Clean and normalize real-time and historical data

Perform spatial alignment (e.g., map data to coordinates or zones)

Aggregate catch trends by location, time, and species

Generate geospatial datasets for model training

4. Database & Storage Layer
Purpose	Technology
Historical catch data	PostgreSQL + PostGIS
Unstructured reports	MongoDB or Firebase DB
Cached map data	Cloud Storage (S3/GCS)
Model metadata/results	PostgreSQL / Redis

5. AI/ML Prediction Engine
Goal: Predict high-probability fishing zones

Frameworks:

TensorFlow / PyTorch

Scikit-learn

Geo-aware libraries (e.g., GeoPandas, Rasterio)

Models Used:

LSTM for time-series forecasting of fishing activity by zone

KMeans/DBSCAN for clustering past successful fishing areas

CNN or Random Forests for spatial zone classification based on environment

Ensemble models combining environment + season + historic patterns

Input Parameters:

Location (lat/lon grid)

Time of day/season

Sea surface temperature, salinity

Previous catch density

Output:

Confidence heatmap of fish-rich zones

Species-specific probability maps

6. Route Optimization Engine
Goal: Suggest the most efficient route to multiple high-probability fishing zones
Algorithms:

A* or Dijkstra‚Äôs for shortest-path calculation

Weighted graph model incorporating:

Fish density (reward)

Distance/fuel cost (penalty)

Hazard zones (negative weights)

Supports:

Single destination optimization

Multi-point optimal tour (like Travelling Salesman Problem)

Tools:

NetworkX (Python)

Turf.js (frontend route analysis)

7. Backend API Layer
Framework: Flask / FastAPI / Node.js
Functionality:

User authentication and session management

Endpoint for submitting and retrieving catch data

Endpoint for fetching predictions and optimized routes

Integration with third-party APIs for weather and ocean data

Caching results for faster response

Security:

JWT-based user authentication

Role-based access (admin, user, data analyst)

Rate-limiting and input validation

8. Map Visualization Layer
Libraries:

Mapbox GL JS / Leaflet.js / Google Maps SDK

Turf.js for spatial analysis on client side

Map Layers:

Heatmaps of predicted fish zones

Forecast overlays (weather, waves)

Suggested navigation routes

Species filters and time-based visualization slider
